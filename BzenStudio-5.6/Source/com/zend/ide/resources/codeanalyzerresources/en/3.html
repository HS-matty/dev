Assignments in a conditional statement are sometimes the result of a typo.
In many cases, instead of the assignment operator =, the equality operator ==
should be used.
When comparing a variable and a non-variable expression, it is common practice
to put the variable on the right-hand side of the equality operator, so that if
the equality operator is erroneously replaced with the assignment operator, PHP
will report a parse error immediately.  This helps you avoid a big subset of
this class of bugs.


<h3>Example</h3>

<font color="#007700">if (</font><font color="#0000BB">$a </font><font color="#007700">= </font><font color="#0000BB">1</font><font color="#007700">) { </font><font color="#FF8000">// probably it was meant to be $a == 1 here
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font color="#007700">...
<br>}
<br></font>
</font>

<!--
if ($a = 1) { // probably it was meant to be $a == 1 here
	...
}
